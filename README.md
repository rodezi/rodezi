# 👋 Hi, I'm Rodrigo Zayas

I'm an AI Engineer focused on building practical, real-world AI solutions — from intelligent agents and workflow automation to data analysis and production-ready machine learning models.

I specialize in integrating technologies like **LLMs**, **AI Agents**, and different **APIs** to deliver smart systems that solve real business problems.

## 🚀 My Mission

To design, build and deploy intelligent systems that solve real-world problems through applied AI. I'm especially interested in agentic workflows, knowledge-grounded chatbots, and real-time AI-powered customer support.

## 💼 What I Build

- 🤖 **AI Agents** — Intelligent agents for sales, customer support, and automated follow-ups  
- 🧠 **ML & GenAI Solutions** — End-to-end machine learning and LLM integrations, applied to real-world business flows  
- 📊 **Data Tools** — Dashboards and behavior prediction models using Python & SQL  
- 🔄 **Automation Systems** — Custom flows integrated with CRMs like HubSpot, Airtable, Kommo, and more
